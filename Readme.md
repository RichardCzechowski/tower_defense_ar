# Installation Instructions: 

	Included is a zip of the unity assets. In order to  get the full experience, you must play it on an ipad, but since we have not uploaded it to the app store, you will have to follow the instructions found here (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/mobile-touch/building-your-unity-game-ios-device-testing) to build an XCode project for your iPad.


### If you want to just preview the game in a non-ideal state:
	unzip “Cloud Platform.zip”
	open “scene 1.unity” with the unity game engine”
	from within unity, hit play
	This will run the game using your computer’s webcam from within unity
	Note: The UI is geared toward the iPad, so certain aspects may not appear as intended

### To Play:
	1. Start Game (see installation instructions)
	2. Print the included “GameBoard.jpg”
	3. Place it somewhere your iPad or webcam can see
	4. After the splash screen, make sure the game board is acquired by the camera
	5. Once the game board is acquired a tower will appear and begin being attacked by waves of enemies.
	6. The Arrow buttons on the left hand side of the screen rotate the tower
	7. The three buttons on the right shoot projectiles from the corner of the tower that aligns with that color
	8. Each enemy type is only vulnerable to one kind of projectile.
	9. Compete for high scores!
	10. FUN BONUS: Play with a friend! One of you handles the right side of the screen while another handles the left!
